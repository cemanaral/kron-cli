# kron

**kron** will become a tool for managing cron jobs for remote hosts. It will enable sysadmins to list/create/delete/edit jobs on specified list of target hosts using ssh protocol, so no dependencies will be required on the target hosts.

I aim to learn go and cli development while developing this.

Any contribution is welcome! You can reach me from **cemanaral@hotmail.com**
